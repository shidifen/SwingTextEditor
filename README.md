# SwingTextEditor
# S. Dragoman, 2017

This is my first project developed from scratch using Java Swing.

Swing Text Editor is a very basic, well, text editor.
Features:
- functional opening/saving of text files
- functional undo/redo capability
- functional word wrap
- multiple (vertical) tabs can be added
- a (bug-free!) tic-tac-toe game is hidden in one of the menus
